# Churn Analysis


## Problem Overview:
Customer churn is defined as when you lose your customer for any reason, which affects the business, as usually the cost of attracting new customers is higher than retaining current ones. 

In this study we will carefully look at churning patterns to help the company tailor its retention strategy by understanding what may cause the customers to churn and what customers are at high risk of churning.

The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.
